Security

Cloud storage services, like Google Drive, and Iphone can view and monitor all
files you upload. If you need to use cloud storage, use a zero-knowledge service
with end-to-end encryption. These services claim to not know what the users
upload to their servers. They also feature client-side end-to-end encryption to
prevent those who don't have the encryption key from viewing your files.

● [Signal](https://signal.org/)
If you want to send text or voice messages to other users, it's best to make sure
you are using a messaging service that offers end-to-end encryption. Signal is
one of the most secure apps for sending and receiving private messages.

WhatsApp is Not Recommended

[Use a Proxy Server](https://www.wikihow.com/Connect-to-a-Proxy-Server)

A proxy server works much the same way as a VPN. They mask your IP
address and make it harder to be tracked. Proxy servers tend to be less
secure than a VPN, but they tend to be cheaper (often free). Proxy servers
are great to connect to when you are using a public Wi-Fi network.
