What Gender Affirming Care Can I Receive in Tennessee?

 Currently, gender affirming medical care is illegal in the state of Tennessee for all minors, regardless of parental consent. Gender affirming therapy is the only legal form of gender 
affirming care for minors. LGBTQ+ affirming can be found [here](https://southernequality.org/resources/transinthesouth/).
  If gender affirming medication is needed, the nearest legal state to receive this medication is Illinois. [Choices Carbondale](https://yourchoices.org/carbondale-lgbtq-health-services/) is a clinic 
based in Carbondale, Illinois which sees out of state patients who are minors.

How Do I Get Out-Of-State Gender Affirming Care?

 In order to receive gender-affirming care at Choices, you must first receive a letter of recommendation from a licensed therapist stating that you have exhibited gender dysphoria
for at least six months. You cannot be seen by the clinic without this letter of recommendation.
  Patients under the age of 18 must have a legal guardian present with them during their appointment. Only one legal guardian must be present and only one person who is not the
doctor or patient will be allowed in the room during the consultation. It is imperative that legal guardians bring some form of government issued ID (most often a driverâ€™s license) 
and a document showing that they are the legal guardian of the patient. Usually, this document is a birth certificate, but if that is not available, call CHOICES at 618-300-6017 
and they can help you find an alternative document.

What Is The Process Like For Getting Out-Of-State Gender Affirming Care?

 Doctors at CHOICES will talk you through all available options and help you to choose a medication that works for you. All prescriptions will be filled that day at an Illinois pharmacy. 
CHOICES does not perform gender-affirming surgery, but can help you navigate those questions and find a medical provider if a surgical option is chosen.
Patients receiving gender affirming medication will be asked to come to follow up appointments every three months. These appointments must be in person and prescriptions will be refilled then.

What Is The Cost of Gender Affirming Care?

  Thanks to the Southern Youth Trans Equity Fund, minors living in trans-restrictive states like Tennessee will have all medical expenses covered. The initial visit, follow up visits, and medication will likely be entirely free of charge.
  CHOICES can always help families navigate these financial questions, including questions about transportation and associated costs.
